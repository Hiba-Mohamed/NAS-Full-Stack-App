        <p>
          The NAS (Nurses Assignment Sheet) is an electronic document that
          replaces the paper-based nurse assignment sheet used in some healthcare
          settings. It is used to communicate vital information to nurses and the
          healthcare team members throughout the shift.

        <p>
          My background as a healthcare professional, coupled with my keen
          interest in healthcare and enterprise efficiency and innovation,
          triggered me to think of ways to help advance healthcare issues existing
          in some healthcare areas. Moving to an electronic version that replaces
          the paper-based nurse assignment sheets provides several advantages,
          including but not limited to efficiency, error reduction, data analysis
          and reporting, and a positive environmental impact.
